            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Giant Galaxy Orbiting Our Own Just Appeared Out of Nowhere</h1><p>Researchers scanning the skies just got a big surprise. They spotted a humongous galaxy orbiting our own, where none had been seen before. It appeared, seemingly, out of nowhere.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Behind The Waldorf Astoria Bar Book's Brand New Update</h1><p>There are few cocktail guides with as much history as "The Old-Waldorf Astoria Bar Book" by Albert Stevens Crockett. The original source material, "Old Waldorf Bar Days" (1931), also by Crockett, was penned during Prohibition but the author rewrote it as we know it in 1933 when Prohibition ended.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/c1d32105a54d9d89e483ba0384354f52d2dcf9ef.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Tesla Will Destroy the Automobile Industry</h1><p>If there's an example of a company about to disruptively innovate an entire industry, it's Tesla. Partly, this is because of raw technology--Tesla's is clearly superior to that of its competitors. Partly, it's because Tesla has a more efficient business model.
